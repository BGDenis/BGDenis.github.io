                        <p>
                            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty
                            open-minded research facility — as long as the
                            subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and
                            technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated
                            researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to
                            have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you
                            submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,
                            in order of priority:

                        </ol>
                        <p>please can you provide more information on
                            each of these subjects, including how long you'd
                            expect the research to take, required staff and
                            other
                            resources, and anything else you think we'd need
                            to know? Thanks.</p>
                        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
                        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate
                            work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer
                            your question, my favourite dances are as follows,
                            with definitions:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                            <dd>
                                A little known but very influential dance dating
                                back as far as 300 <abbr title="Before Common
                                    Era">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance
                                around in a circle like chickens, to encourage
                                their livestock to be "fruitful".
                            </dd>
                            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means
                                of getting warm, they used to practice this
                                dance, which involved huddling close together in
                                a circle on the floor, and shuffling their
                                bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid
                                movements. One of my fellow students used to say
                                that he thought this dance inspired modern
                                styles such as <strong>Twerking</strong>.

                            <dd>
                                An interesting example of historic
                                misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
                                believed to have discovered a new dance style
                                characterized by <em>"robotic"</em>, stilted
                                movements, being practiced by inhabitants of
                                Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it
                                was discovered that they were just moving like
                                this because they were really cold.
